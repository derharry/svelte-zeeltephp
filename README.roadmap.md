# Roadmap / ideas
- more documentation and examples
- support other +.php like +server,api,hooks (17.05 prepared for)
- support more event types at ZP_EventDetails to handle more use-cases.
- PHP 
  - use namespaces
  - LIB return/add more lib methods/classes
- Ideas:
  - Live public Demo
  - Install via Github-Releases or as NPM-package
  - load response data from zp_fetch_api() directly into $page.data or $page.form to use export let data and form;
  - make PUBLIC_ZEELTEPHP_BASE optional and use just BASE. If set - its to let /api/zeeltephp work at different name or location.
